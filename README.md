# React Card Layout Template
This is a card layout template which I created using React to practice my UI and React skills. 

The main webpage consists of 2 components, the navbar and the input. The input takes the card list as a child, which it passes the list information onto by using the React hook `createContext` and `useContext`.

To run this project, fork the repo and clone it to your machine.  
`cd` into the project folder  
Then run `npm install` to install node dependencies  
Then `npm run dev` to run it locally
